**Catch That Crook!** is a 3D educational game where you play as a cashier in a toy store. Your goal is to catch NPCs (non-player characters) who attempt to shoplift. Observe their behavior, make quick decisions, and catch them before they escape!

## üéÆ Game Overview

> *‚ÄúKeep your eyes sharp. Some customers have sticky fingers.‚Äù*

You are the store's only line of defense against theft. Some NPCs will attempt to steal items as they browse. Your job is to stop them before they leave. Each encounter requires close observation ‚Äî who‚Äôs just shopping, and who‚Äôs trying to sneak out unpaid?

The game raises awareness about shoplifting and encourages ethical behavior through fun and interactive gameplay.
